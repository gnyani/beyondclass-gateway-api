1. Development task:
    * Back-end:
        * Database Design
        * Once we understand what data we should process,if its structural go for relational database since read operations are faster in relational DB when compared to any other DB.
        * If we think that our data is write intensive then we should think another DB option.
        * Once we have the Design Ready, We  Should think about which technologies best fits our need.
        * Once we come up with that we can start our work:
            * Setting up environment: Git project, IDE, related software installation, we should be able to run hello world end to end
            * Development: Split the project into multiple features and divide between us and start working on them. We should also take care about environments we might need to have Dev and Prod environments.
            * There should not be any hard coding it should be easily scalable and easily managable.
            * We should finish back-end work as quickly as and as efficiently as possible because front-end takes more time to develop than back-end for us since we both are naive  in that area.
    * Front-End:
        1. Web end-point:
            * Decide on technologies and start developing a good UI.
            * Integrate with Back-end.
        1. Android App end-point:
            * Not sure about this now, We should try to use the same backend for this as well. I donâ€™ft know whether it is possible or not.
2. Advertising and Making people know about this:
    * We need more experience for this bro, We  have to go to start up battle fields and just learn from der, Once we are sure about our work we can either directly release it or just participate in a Start-Up battle field and get someone to invest on us.
