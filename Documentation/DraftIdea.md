**Automating all of engineering maual stuff (we can call it as Engineering Adda we will decide on this later)**

* Any idea will mostly succeeded either if it solves a realtime unsolved problem or if it makes some work quite simple.
* I will list out couple of problems most engineering students face.
    * Living:
        * No Proper food
        * No good hostel
        * Less Money
        * Lack of room availability
        * Transport
    * Study:
        * we dont know syllabus.
        * We dont have resources to study stuff and we waste a lot of time.
        * Assignment or notes written for 1st internal will not be available for finals  to revise.
        * We never write our own assignments ( we need something to copy from)
        * No Books üòÄ for studying 
    * Life:
        * Clothing
        * Accessories
* Right now I can think of only these we can add up.
* I feel we can address most of these problems at a single place either directly and indirectly and make money out of it.
Things to Implement to address these problems:
 
* Since we cant invest big amounts this we can develop a prototype which can address most of these problems and If we can implement it so well we need not think about investment because we can raise crowd funding if at all we become that big.
* What We can do immediately:
    * We can collect the details of all the people who will register on this application including their college,class,section,roll number and we can group all these people in to groups based on their section, One advantage with this is if anyone who writes up an assignment he can just upload to this app then all his classmates should be able to save that assignment and copy it to complete their assignments and they can reuse this assignment to study during finals.
    * He/She should be able to download previous question papers of his branch since we collect his branch name as well during registration.
    * He/She should be able to see syllabus of his semester whenever required,he should not search for syllabus book or he should not install a separate app only for the sake of syllabus.
    * It would be awesome if He/She would be able to see their attendance. (To do these we need to get access to college DB which I am a bit skeptical about.)
    * We can even address about competitive exams like GATE,GRE,CAT.
* What we can do as we expand:
    * We can partner with hostels and recommend their hostels to students and collect  money for every student he gets because of our app ( I don‚Äôt know how we can do this might be simple not sure).
    * Students should be able to order professional guides,text books and pens and pencils based of some constraints, we should partner with stationaries related to that area and should make an agreement with him.
    * We can partner with super markets and deliver groceries if required.
    * We can even partner with Book My Show and get people notified of new releases  and collect some money for each impression they get
    * We can advertise about anything here because engineers do everything once our user base become big enough.
    * If we grow big we can start selling things on our own and make huge profits.

 Revenue Sources for us:
* Food : We can partner with dominos or any existing online food delivery system in place and take a share of 2-3% on every order ( we can do this in future maybe)
* Hostels: We can partner with some hostel and recommend their hostel in suggestions and get paid for doing so.
* Institutions:We can partner with educational institutions and make some money
* Stationery: We can make some money by partnering with these guys.
* Acquisition: If we can grow that big and if someone acquires this app then our descendants wont think ‚ÄúWish my dad was rich‚Äù.
Pros:
* I dont see any other apps doing this, If we can implement perfectly we can forget about competitors in this area.You also do some research on this.
* Even if we fail we will become full stack developers.
* I see money can come to us if we can implement this perfectly.
* If I do this I think I will stop feeling bad about my life at least we tried something even if we fail.
* Most important thing: We will be cofounders and we wont work under anybody that gives me utter pride even for you üòõ. 
Cons:
* We fucking give up so early without even trying.
* We Will have the most difficult times when we need to partner with people and companies.
* We will face problems in advertising.
* We will think about 2 & 3 and do 1. Doing 1 is the worst thing I feel, Its like running away from problems which I don‚Äôt like.
* TIME:Until we develop prototype and make some progress we have to work really hard on weekends and during our free times, I am desperate to try out something new and I believe we can try this.

VISION:
* To make engineering easier and a bit comfortable.

MISSION:
* All our audience i.e.,(All engineering students who use smart phone) should use this application for now we can aim for Hyderabad, we can gradually expand as we grow.
Strategy & Action Plan:
* We Both have to allocate some time to start working on how we are going to execute this idea.

High-Level plan for now:
* We should start developing this thing immediately and if we can see future in this we can jump in to this for full-time.
* Flipkart would have been not der if Bansal‚Äôs have not resigned amazon,There are many examples like this bro, we should make this happen.
* What we need is money but our vision and mission should never be money because Indians don‚Äôt like giving you money if you explicitly ask them for money.
* If we can implement this Nicely earning lots of money is implicit.


Destro, Add points or edit these if you feel something needs to be changed. I decided bro I am going to work on something else other than my job because I am sure it is not going to help me in my future. If you are okay with this idea we can start working hard. If you have any other suggestion we can think again and decide what to implement.
