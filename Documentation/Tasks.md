* Pojo creation with the following variables 
    * branch 
    * year 
    * semester
    * subject
    * supplementary
    * paper (file) (This should already be loaded in DB and based on the details provided you should be able to query this)
* New Rest controller for querying question papers from DB
* After you are done with this you can start working on Google&FB signup.

Syllabus(Gnyani):
* Almost Similar to Question papers will start working on this after I finish login
Assignments(GnaynI/Manoj):
* Similar to the above two but we might need some kind of authentication if required, we have to decide on this before working
Posts(Gnyani/Manoj):
* This also takes similar development effort but we need to make some more refinements, we need to maintain likes who posted etc, image should be posted from user unlike others
* We should also think about expiration policy because we will get flooded with posts.

After these are done we need to take some more tasks lets finish these as soon as possible.
